### Product Vision

Our product aims to create a 3D map program that will provide a helpful navigation tool for individuals visiting or studying at Macalester College's Olin Rice building. The program will serve as a valuable resource for new visitors, first-year students, and people studying social science and arts disciplines who are unfamiliar with the building's layout. 

Our goal is to create a user-friendly interface that will enable users to quickly and easily navigate the building, saving them time and minimizing confusion.
