## Product vision:

Our product aims to create a 3D map program that will provide a helpful navigation tool for individuals visiting or studying at Macalester College's Olin Rice building. The program will serve as a valuable resource for new visitors, first-year students, and people studying social science and arts disciplines who are unfamiliar with the building's layout. Our goal is to create a user-friendly interface that will enable users to quickly and easily navigate the building, saving them time and minimizing confusion.


## Bug/missing features:

Currently, our project is functioning smoothly. However, there are still some missing details about the navigation data structure that we aim to address in future updates. For example, the app does not yet provide information on the usage of the exit staircase or the path to some classrooms and the Theatre building. We plan to work on incorporating these missing features into the program as we move forward.

## Dev docs:

Our app is built using the Unity engine, which provides a user-friendly and highly customizable development environment. We have utilized several libraries and assets in the app's creation, including the NavMesh library for agent navigation, TileMap for building representation, texture mapping for building aesthetics, and various Unity assets for working UI components.

To build the app on iPhones, users can utilize X-Code with an IOS developer subscription. Alternatively, the program can be run on a PC by cloning the project from our Github page and loading the folder with Unity. The app can also be built for Android phones with Unity's Android java build runtimes.

## Conclusion 

Overall, our project is aimed at creating a helpful navigation tool for individuals studying or visiting the Olin Rice building of Macalester College. We are dedicated to continuing development to address any missing features and to ensure that our product remains accessible to new users and developers alike.
